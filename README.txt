This project is a simple biometric reader program.

The user puts on the biometric device and proceeds by pressing the start button. After the simulation is begun, a real-time feed of their Skin Conductance Level and Heart Rate Variance will be available for viewing. Additionally, all of the user's biometric data will be saved into a .txt file for later data processing. 

For confidential reasons, all files have not been included within this repository. The required library files needed to run the hardware completely will not be supplied. 

Sample data can be found in the added file "SCLdata.txt"
